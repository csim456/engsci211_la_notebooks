    "\n",
    "This notebook contains one interactive visualisation (see below for details) on the topic of coordinate transformation and eigenvectors.\n",

    "**Note**: this visualisation contains a few bugs and other issues. In particular, the *custom* option is known not to work.\n",

    "### CoordinateTransform()\n",
    "This demo contains one plot, showing a shape represented as a set of $xy$ coordinates, stored in a two-row matrix $P_{xy}$. This shape can be transformed by a linear transformation matrix of order $2 \\times 2$, such that $P_{uv} = T\\,P_{xy}$. Different transform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shape**: there are three possible shapes to choose from: square (default), triangle or arrow. Each shape can be represented by a set of $xy$ coordinates, stored in a two-row matrix $P_{xy}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformation**: the type of shape transformation can be selected from the second drop-down menu. The default is *scale*, which represents a linear scaling of the shape in both $x$ and $y$ directions. Many other options are included. Please note that the *custom* option currently doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Show Mat**: you can choose to show the transformation matrix, $T$, which will appear above the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Show Eigs**: you can choose to show the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transformation matrix, which satisfy: $T\\,\\vec{s}_i = \\lambda_i \\, \\vec{s}_i$. Note: this works best with the *all* option for the transformation matrix. The lines being shown are $\\lambda_i \\, \\vec{s}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalise Eigs**: you can choose to normalise the eigenvectors being shown i.e. $\\hat{s}_i$."
